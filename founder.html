                Our founder's journey is a testament to resilience and dedication. With a degree in English and a Masters in Economics, he overcame the hardships of poverty in his village. His determination led him to Urban Bareilly, 243001, where he established a learning institute dedicated to assisting underprivileged students. His vision was to provide a platform for those in need to access quality education and support their learning journey. His efforts have profoundly impacted countless lives, offering hope and opportunities to those who might otherwise have been left behind.
